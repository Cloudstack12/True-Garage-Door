                            <p>
                                Inspect your garage door regularly for signs of wear and tear, such as cracks, dents, and rust. Address any issues promptly to prevent further damage. Regularly clean your garage door with mild detergent and water to remove dirt and debris that can cause damage to the door’s surface. <br>

                                Lubricate the moving parts of your garage door, such as the hinges, rollers, and springs, to ensure they operate smoothly and prevent wear and tear. Test the safety features of your garage door, such as the photo-eye sensors and auto-reverse function, to ensure they are working correctly and prevent accidents.
                            </p></div></div>
                            <p>
                                Check the balance of your garage door by disconnecting the opener and manually opening and closing the door. If the door is difficult to open or close or moves unevenly, there could be an issue with the springs or tracks. Tighten any loose screws or bolts on your garage door and tracks to ensure they are secure and prevent the door from becoming unstable. Keep the tracks of your garage door clear of debris and obstructions, such as leaves and rocks, to ensure smooth operation and prevent damage.
